# P2 Requirements

Full stack app

* Leveraging angular as the frontend
* Leveraging spring as the backend
* Cloud DB, deployed backend to cloud with CD pipeline
* Public git repo on our organization

Stretch goals (in order of priority):

* Unit testing for backend
* Unit testing for frontend
* Deployed frontend to cloud with CD pipeline

2 good ways to decide groups:
team leads are basically necessary
- either choose the remaining members randomly, or we can use a drafting system

4 team leads:

matt
harveen
riley
eugene

example projects that have worked well in the past:
- Pet adoption app
- Employee management system (managing promotions etc)
- Sports meetup app (publish events on the site, and other users can register for them)
- Card games + store (users could purchase trading cards)

Most likely, the central concept of your project idea can be completed with 3-4 tables and associated endpoints - mostly CRUD - do not overplan

With agile methodology, we don't need to conduct all planning, design, and implementation all at once. We can instead select individual features and work on them independently.

Even though teams usually fall into backend/frontend/devops roles, I still recommend everyone make maybe a pet project in spring/angular - because having a single person working on your entire frontend or backend usually causes issues
